## Description

This is a repository that contains my custom Tweaks for Windows 10

**Usage:** I start by running the [main script (Win10.ps1)](https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script/blob/master/Win10.ps1) with my custom preset (DaNy3LL.preset). After executing my custom preset, I add my personal tweaks (see "After executing my presets" folder).

**NOTE:** I also have a script that automatically installs software via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) and creates a scheduled task to update them automatically.

The main script belongs to [Disassembler0](https://github.com/Disassembler0/Win10-Initial-Setup-Script)
